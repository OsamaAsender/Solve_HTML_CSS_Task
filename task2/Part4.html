   <p> A fish (pl.: fish or fishes) is an aquatic, craniate,
     gill-bearing animal that lacks limbs with digits.
      Included in this definition are the living hagfish,
       lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. 
       Approximately 95% of living fish species are ray-finned fish,
        belonging to the class Actinopterygii,
     with around 99% of those being teleosts.</p>
