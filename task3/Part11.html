        From director <b>Vicki Fleming </b>comes the heartwarming tale of a boy named Pete (Trent Dugson)
         and his dog Rover 
        (voiced by Brinson Lumblebrunt).
         You may think a boy and his dog learnin the true value of friendship sounds familiar,
          but a big twist sets this flick apart: Rover plays basketball
        , and he's doggone good at it.
    </p>

    <p>this movie has eveything you could ask for :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basketball</li>
        <li>A Dog</li>
        <li>A Nail-Biting suspense</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    While it may not have been necessary to include all 150 minutes of Rover's 
    championship game in real time, Basketball Dog will keep your interest for the entirety of 
    its 4-hour runtime, and the end will have any dog lover in tears. If you love basketball or 
    sports pets, this is the movie for you.
