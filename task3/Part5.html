            This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday.
             He may look happy, but he's a little disappointed.
             Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.
        </p>
        <p>Jack would really like...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Roller blades</li>
            <li>Magic tricks</li>
            <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
            <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store.
             Two very popular ones are <a href="#">toysrus.com</a> and <a href="#">eToys</a>.
