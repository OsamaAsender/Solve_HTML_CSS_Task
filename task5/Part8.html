    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally
      smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape,
      cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats. Small boats
      are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in
      protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were
      intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat
      is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship
